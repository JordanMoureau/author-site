# Tuesday Again

There is something about Tuesdays.

In Aster’s world, things tend to happen on Tuesdays.

In my world, Tuesdays feel like a hinge. Not quite the chaos of Monday. Not yet the relief of Friday. Just steady forward movement.

It’s the day you sit down and decide who you’re going to be this week.

Are we drafting?  
Are we editing?  
Are we spiraling?

Preferably not the last one.

Today was a drafting day.

Which means:

- Coffee.
- Focus.
- Slightly unhinged dialogue exchanges.
- The quiet hum of a story expanding.

There’s a specific kind of peace that comes from writing something that feels aligned. Not flashy. Not strategic. Just true to the world and the character.

Aster continues to be stubborn.  
Wolf continues to be suspiciously calm.  
I continue to laugh at my own jokes.

All is as it should be.

If Tuesdays are for anything, they’re for momentum.

And I’ll take that.
