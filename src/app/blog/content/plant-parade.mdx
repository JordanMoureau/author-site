# Plant Parade (Or: My Office Is Slowly Becoming a Jungle)

I don’t know when it happened.

One plant became two.  
Two became five.  
Five became “I think we need another shelf.”

My writing desk now exists inside what can only be described as a polite, well-watered ecosystem.

And honestly?

I love it.

There’s something grounding about tending to something living while building a fictional world. Plants don’t care about launch dates or word counts. They just need light, water, and mild respect.

Drafting Aster feels similar.

You show up.  
You tend it.  
You don’t scream at it to grow faster.

And eventually it does.

My current lineup includes:

- One dramatic trailing vine
- Two leafy overachievers
- A plant I’m 80% sure is judging me
- Several tiny hopefuls

I like the idea that while I’m writing about mercenaries and undead princesses, something quietly green is thriving nearby.

It makes the whole thing feel balanced.

Also if this author thing fails, I could absolutely pivot to “woman who lives in tasteful jungle and writes mildly aggressive blog posts.”

There are worse fates.
