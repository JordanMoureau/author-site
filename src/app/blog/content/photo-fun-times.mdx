# Photo Fun Times (Or: How Many Drafts Does It Take?)

I have a confession.

I am not good at author photos.

I always think I’m going to look windswept and mysterious and instead I look like I’ve just been informed the kingdom is out of bread.

Taking promo photos for _Aster of Warhaven_ has been a journey. A journey involving:

- Approximately 147 discarded expressions
- Wind that refuses to cooperate
- One eyebrow that has its own agenda
- Children shouting “WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?” from inside the house

But here’s the thing.

It matters.

Not because I need to look perfect.  
Not because I need to look “authorly.”

But because this is part of building a world.

Aster exists in a fully realized universe. It deserves a fully realized creator presence. So yes, I will stand in a field holding a sword. Yes, I will redo the shot twelve times. Yes, I will insist on natural lighting like I know what I’m talking about.

This is the fun part.

This is the “we’re doing this for real” part.

And if nothing else, at least one of the photos made me look slightly less confused than usual.

Victory.
