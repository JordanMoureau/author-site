# Where Art Thou (Or: The Perils of Creating Your Own Cover Art)

There is a special kind of madness that comes from deciding to illustrate your own book cover.

I do not recommend it.

And yet here we are.

The process so far has involved:

- Adjusting one shoulder plate seventeen times
- Reconsidering color palettes at 10:47pm
- Debating whether the sky is “heroic” enough
- Zooming in to 300% and questioning every life choice

But here’s the thing.

No one sees Aster the way I do.

The posture.  
The expression.  
The slight tilt of defiance.

It matters.

And if I’m going to build this world independently, I might as well go all in.

Art, like writing, is iterative. You think you’re done. You’re not. You move one highlight. Suddenly it works.

I don’t need the cover to be perfect.

I need it to feel like her.

And when it finally clicks?

That’s the moment you remember why you’re doing all of this in the first place.
